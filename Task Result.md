## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- Nuxt.js

Over the past two years, I've been extensively using Nuxt.js in my current role and for private projects, which has significantly bolstered my understanding with this technology. I like that it support both server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) and the use of composable functions that can be called in any component.

I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project:
