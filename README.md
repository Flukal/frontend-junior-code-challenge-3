# PixelArt - Nuxt 3

## Implementation

- I choosed Nuxt.js because it is a versatile framework, I like how it handles the routes and composable folder, that I didn't need for this project.
- I feel me familiar with the conventions, like directory structure, automatic routing, use of composable folder. Even though I'm confident with my Nuxt.js skills, I'm committed to continuous learning and improvement.
- I have been utilizing Nuxt.js for the past two years at my current company, where I have significantly enhanced my knowledge and proficiency in this technology.

## Use of 3rd party libraries

I used in this project three libraries html2canvas and jspdf to handle the creation and export of pdf or png file.

Html2canvas builds a "screenshot" of the web page or part of it based on the Dom and the informations available on the page.
Jspdf is used to create a PDF file, adding texts, images and other contents, giving the user the possibility to download the file.

I used Tailwind CSS because it makes the styling of components way faster and consistence.
